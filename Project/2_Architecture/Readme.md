## Sensors:
# Vibration Sensor:
Vibration can be defined as the mechanical oscillation about equilibrium position of a machine or component or simply the back and forth motion of a machine or component.Vibration in industrial equipment is sometimes part of the normal operation but sometimes it can be a sign of trouble.A vibration sensor either connects directly to an asset or monitors it wirelessly.Once placed it will detect vibrations from the asset through various means,depending on the type of sensor.
# Ultrasonic sensor:
An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal.Ultrasonic waves travel faster than the speed of audible sound.
